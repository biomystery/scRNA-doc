# QC 

## Complexity & sensitivity 
  * >80,000 usable reads per nuc required 
  * avg 160,000 reads per nuc for **saturation analysis**

## Metrics 
  * for single-nuc profile 
	* total number of reads (coding regions and UTRs) 
	* # genes detected per nuc 
	* % of total number of reads assigned to nuc barcodes from:
	  1. coding regions
	  2. UTRs 
	  3. Intron regions 
	  4. Intergenic regions 
	  5. rRNA 
	  6. transcripts from the mitochondrial genome
